# Data-Analysis-4
Objective of the Analysis:

The primary goal of this analysis was to examine the relationship between wind speed and humidity in Delhi, India, using weather data from 2013 to 2017. The analyst employed statistical methods and various visualizations to test the hypothesis that humidity decreases as wind speed increases. Key steps included calculating correlation coefficients, checking data normality, and generating multiple plots to explore trends.

Positive Aspects of the Analysis:

Diverse Statistical Methods:
The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess data normality.
Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient was calculated to measure the relationship between variables.

Effective Visualizations:
Scatter plots, histograms, box plots, and network graphs clearly illustrated the relationship between variables.
Density plots and bar charts effectively displayed data distributions and monthly trends.

Comprehensive and Structured Approach:
The analyst presented the workflow clearly, from data exploration to conclusion.
Conclusions were evidence-based, supported by statistical tests and graphical analysis, with acknowledgment of the weak correlation.

Use of R Programming:
The analysis was conducted in R, a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization, ensuring accuracy and professionalism.

Suggestions for Future Research:
The analyst noted the limitations of the weak correlation and recommended investigating other influencing factors, demonstrating a thorough and forward-thinking approach.
